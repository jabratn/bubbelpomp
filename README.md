# Bubble pump

## Introduction
The bubble pump is a variant on the air-lift principle. When air is blown in a pipe or hose (under water) the rising bubles will force water upwards. Typically an air-lift pump will operate more efficiently when the inlet is placed deeper under water. The air will have to be more pressurised when the inlet is located further under the water surface. Therefore, when the bubles rise up they will expand more and increase the velocity of the rising water. This increases the pump capacity and efficiency. A variant of the air-lift pump operating at higher pressure is the geyser pump; here larger bubbles are created using a siphon principle. A chamber is filled with pressurized air, effectively displacing water until the deepest part of a siphon is exposed and the air chamber content is released suddenly in large bubble. Because of the high pressure, the bubble may carry a larger volume of water, again because it expands on its way up in the pump pipe or hose.

Our bubble pump is a poor man's version of the geyser pump. It is designed to be used with relatively small and cheap electrical air pumps that can be operated by simple and cheap solar panels. Typically the maximum air pressure difference these pumps can produce is 0.3\[bar\]. And therefore we cannot place our bubble pump much deeper than approximately 2 meters below the water surface. However, by design we make it easy to tune the size of the air bubble chamber such that you can optimize the pump for the depth of the water source (well or otherwise). The geyser effect will be negligible and the output not too high, but the main idea of this pump is that it may provide a small but steady stream of water. The supply can be either applied directly (e.g. irrigation, feeding life stock, etc) or stored for later use (e.g. a pond or storage tank).
